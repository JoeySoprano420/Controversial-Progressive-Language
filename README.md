Overview
Language Name: Controversial-Progressive Syntax (CPS)
Compile/Interpret Chain:
AOT (Ahead-of-Time): Compiled by Python into Byte Code.
OTF (On-the-Fly): Interpreted by C++ into Machine Code.
JIT (Just-In-Time): Compiled into Executable Binaries.
Design Specifications
Paradigm:

Controversial-Progressive: Emphasizes innovative but debated approaches.
Syntax:

Stiff-Static: Rigid and static, but flexible enough for readability.
Indentation: Direct-justified to ensure clarity.
Semantics:

Dynamic-NLP: Utilizes dynamic and natural language processing for interpreting code.
Grammar:

Strong-Intrinsically Intuitive: Designed to be naturally intuitive to understand and use.
Styling:

Transitional-Ladder: Supports a transitional approach to styling, adapting from basic to complex.
Structure:

Formant-Forced-Fluid: Structured to be fluid while maintaining a forced formant for consistency.
Overall Approach:

Flexible-Standard-Stagnated: Combines flexibility with adherence to standards, albeit with some limitations.
Whitespace Handling:

Ignore White Space: Spaces and tabs are irrelevant to parsing and execution.
Error Handling:

Recursive Duplexity: Uses a dual-layered recursive approach for managing errors.
Pattern Matching:

Synchronized: Pattern matching is synchronized across different parts of the code.
Processing:

Fluctuating Parallel Processing: Allows for parallel execution with fluctuating workloads.
Asynchronous-Dormant Flex Code: Adaptable code execution based on situational needs.
Conditionals and Types:

Open-Closed Conditionals: Conditional structures that can be extended but not modified.
Excessive Types: Numerous data types for comprehensive control.
Key Components:

Controls: Manage flow and execution.
Var, Val, Tokens: Definitions for variable declarations, value assignments, and token management.
Flows: Define the direction of data and execution.
Libraries, APIs: Support for external code integration.
Enablers, Initiators, Closers, Enders: Define execution lifecycle stages.
Directors, Pointers, Caps: Control execution flow and data manipulation.
Directives, Identifiers, Packets: Guide the interpretation and compilation of code.
Serialization and Security:

Non-Specified Serialization: Custom serialization formats.
Ultra Encrypted: Highly secure data encryption.
Hashed, Salted, Folded, Deleted, Ciphered, Notarized, Sanitized: Multiple layers of data protection and verification.
Packaging and Containing:

IAA (Innate Automated Abstracted): Automated packaging and abstraction.
P&C (Packaging and Containing): Bundles code into executable files.
Implementation Strategy
Define Syntax and Grammar:

Create a grammar specification that outlines the syntax rules and structures.
Develop a parser in Python to convert the CPS code into an intermediate byte code.
Compile to Byte Code:

Use Python to perform AOT compilation into a bytecode that is platform-independent.
Interpret Byte Code:

Develop an interpreter in C++ to convert bytecode into machine code, ensuring efficient execution.
JIT Compilation:

Implement a JIT compiler to optimize performance by converting machine code into executable binaries at runtime.
Error Handling:

Design the recursive duplexity system for robust error management.
Parallel and Asynchronous Processing:

Implement support for fluctuating parallel processing and asynchronous execution to handle varying workloads.
Security Features:

Integrate advanced encryption, hashing, and security measures for data protection.
Packaging:

Implement IAA and P&C systems to bundle and deploy CPS code as executable files.
